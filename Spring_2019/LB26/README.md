**Title**: Data analysis with Pandas Dataframe: Live coding for beginners

**Abstract**:
This seminar is a beginner’s guide to data analysis with Pandas dataframe. Pandas is a
popular library for manipulating vectors, tables, and time series. We will frequently use
Pandas data structures instead of the built-in python data structures, as they provide much
richer functionality. Also, Pandas is fast, which makes working with large datasets easier. In this session, we will use Grand LAgrangian Deployment (GLAD) drifter data, 
collected by Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport of Hydrocarbon in the 
Environment ([CARTHE](http://carthe.org)). We will cover three main aspects:

1. Introduction to Pandas library and Dataframe
2. Grouping, Indexing and slicing data
3. Make a spagetti plot(drifter trajectories)

Preparation:

Check out the official pandas website at http://pandas.pydata.org.
Pandas should already be part of your anaconda installation. If not, simply run:

```
conda install pandas
```

Please install Jupyter lab if you want to code along (Jupyter Notebook works, too).

```
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

The GLAD drifter data file can be found at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zf2sr8kIV0yWTM62jiPAulIPaONVEMIp/view?usp=sharing
